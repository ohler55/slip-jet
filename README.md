# slip-jet

A NATS JetStream package for SLIP.

## Summary

This SLIP package makes use of the NATS JetStream Simplified Client
API described at
https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go/blob/main/jetstream/README.md#jetstream-simplified-client
or https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nats-io/nats.go/jetstream. The
JetStream API is object based and this package uses Flavors to
implement an object based API for SLIP that closely follows the
JetStream API.
